After messing around with Express for over a day I came to realize Launch School has setup an API and not
a full application, meaning I am to build an application around the API, not to build a full fledged express
application.

In one way this greatly simplifies my work, in another it means the application code will but put into one file,
as of now I cannot use Handlebars with ES6 imports.

Given this I need to still think about how to organize my application.

Features:
1.  Get All Contacts
    a.  This is what happens when the landing page is arrived at.
    b.  This is what happens when the user clicks on the 'Contact Manager' link.
    c.  The template consists of the following:
        i.  A heading with an Add Contact Button and a Search field
        ii. Two partials
            1.  One if there are contacts
            2.  Another if there are no contacts
