in this case, we want a tag, when selected to show all contacts with the same tag.
I think the best place to put such a feature is on the landing page, the user can select a current tag and then
I can add a button which allows the user to see all contacts with the same tag, the results would still be on the
home page.

The other option is to put the feature on the add contact or edit contact form but if we put the feature there we
would have to navigate away from the Forms to see all of the shared contacts.

So the Tags need to be selectable in the home page.

Algorithm:
1.  The button is not selectable if View All Tags is shown (maybe change it to "Tags"?)
2.  Once a tag is selected the button should be selectable, maybe hide the button to begin with.
3.  Maybe the button title should be "Shared Contacts"
4.  As with the other buttons, the button click should be delegated.
5.  Once the button is clicked call the Model to find the shared contacts.
6.  The Shared contacts should be put in the same format as when one gets all contacts.
7.  Initially I am thinking there should not be a back button, as the header link provides this.


On another note if tags is null then there should be no selectable tag
