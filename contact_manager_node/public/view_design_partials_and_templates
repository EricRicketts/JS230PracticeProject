Now that we have the views sketched out and the behavior listed in the view_design_functionality file, we can start
to organize the index file and templates.

My goal is to make the View Object behave in such a way that all it does is receive data and show the data.  However,
there will be some behavior in the form of conditionals in the templates because otherwise my template list would
grow to be too big, there would be too much repetition where two templates might be completely alike except for
a text change.

index.html

1.  Header
    1.  This is in all the views, so this is going to be hard coded in the index file.
    2.  The h1 element "Contact Manager" will be enclosed in an anchor element which href always takes us
    back to the home page.
    3.  There will be a paragraph under the anchor saying the same thing as the demonstrator project.
    4.  A header element with id "home_page_header" will encompass the anchor and paragraph elements.
2.  There will be one main element with id "main_content" which will be the element which sets the width of the
    content under the header, it will receive all of the data from resolving any one of the given template and
    partials.

Templates and Partials

<main>
  <section id="content"></section>
</main>

What do we have for the "content heading"?  We we basically have two variations:
1.  The landing page and searching.
    1.  Add Contact Button, Edit Tags Button, and Search Bar
    2.  Light grey back ground and same color as header for button border and button text.
2.  Forms, Add Contact, Edit Contact, Edit Tags - all that is needed is a header, background is white
3.  Have two different templates
    1.  One for when all contacts are shown or searched for or are show when identifying tags with shared contacts
        1.  Add Contact button
        2.  Edit Tags button
        3.  Search Field
        4.  enclosed in a div so we do not have to put the styling on the parent
    2.  One for when a form is displayed, this only has an h2 element, as with the previous template, it is enclosed
    in a div so the styling does not have to be put in the parent.

The final templates and/or partials to consider are the main content, what do we need?
1.  We need a partial for a contact, this should be enveloped in a div element
2.  We need a template for the contact information it will be a div element which runs through the #each helper
to generate the series of contacts, this needs to be reused for the search results and for displaying the contacts
which share the same tag.
3.  We need a template which is just can h2 element which handles one of the three following situations:
    1.  No contacts -> "There are no contacts."
    2.  No search results -> "There are no contacts with the letter(s) " {{search term}}
    3.  No contacts with the tag -> "There are no contacts with the tag" {{tag name}}
    4.  This needs to be put in a div with a class, as the styling will be the same for all cases.
4.  We need a template for the Add Contact / Edit Contact Form:
    1.  Full name => text field
    2.  Email address => email field
    3.  Telephone number => phone field
    4.  Tags => this field will be text, if Add Contact it will say "none"
    5.  Additional Tag => This is a select element, next to it will be an Add button
    6.  Submit Button => input[type=submit], Cancel Button => an anchor element with href to the home page.
    7.  This obviously needs to be a form element.
    8.  This one template should work, different data will be passed in for each of the fields, as the Edit Contact
    field should have each of the fields filled in with the appropriate data.
5.  There needs to be a partial for the tag Name and Shared Contacts Button
    1.  list item with a span for the tag name and a button which says Shared Contacts button should display as an
    inline block
    2.  The parent item needs to be an unordered list
6.  There needs to be a template for an unordered list
    1.  The list items and their associated Shared Contacts button from the partial above
    2.  Another list item span New Tag, text field and an Add button
    3.  Final list item Done and Cancel Buttons
